# Radio Group

A radio group allows users to make a single choice from a select number of
option

<Resources pkg="@zag-js/radio" />

<Showcase id="Radio" />

**Features**

- Syncs with `disabled` state of fieldset
- Syncs with form `reset` events
- Can programmatically set radio group value
- Can programmatically focus and blur radio items

## Installation

To use the radio machine in your project, run the following command in your
command line:

<CodeSnippet id="radio-group/installation.mdx" />

This command will install the framework agnostic radio group logic and the
reactive utilities for your framework of choice.

## Anatomy

To set up the radio group correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and
how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

On a high level, the radio group consists of:

- **Root**: The root container for the radio group
- **Label**: The label that gives the user information on the radio group
- **Item**: The root container for the each radio item
- **Item Label**: The label that gives the user information on each radio item
- **Item Control**: The element that visually represents the each radio item.
- **Item Input**: The native html input that is visually hidden in each radio
  item.

## Usage

First, import the radio group package into your project

```jsx
import * as radio from "@zag-js/radio"
```

The radio package exports two key functions:

- `machine` — The state machine logic for the radio widget.
- `connect` — The function that translates the machine's state to JSX attributes
  and event handlers.

> You'll also need to provide a unique `id` to the `useMachine` hook. This is used
> to ensure that every part has a unique identifier.

Next, import the required hooks and functions for your framework and use the
radio machine in your project 🔥

<CodeSnippet id="radio-group/usage.mdx" />

## Disabling the radio group

To make a radio group disabled, set the context's `disabled` property to true

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  radio.machine({
    disabled: true,
  }),
)
```

## Readonly radio group

To make a radio group readonly, set the context's `readonly` property to true

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  radio.machine({
    readonly: true,
  }),
)
```

## Setting the initial value

To set the radio group's initial value, set the context's `value` property to
the value of the radio item to be selected by default

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  radio.machine({
    value: "apple",
  }),
)
```

## Listening for changes

When the radio group value changes, the `onChange` callback is invoked.

```jsx {3-8}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  radio.machine({
    onChange({ value }) {
      console.log("radio value is:", value)
      // 'apple' | 'orange' | 'grape'
    },
  }),
)
```

## Methods and Properties

The radio's `api` provides properties and methods you can use to
programmatically read and set the radio group's value.

| Property   | Description                                                                 |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `value`    | Value of the radio group - checked radio item                               |
| `setValue` | Methid to set the value of the radio group                                  |
| `focus`    | Function used to focus radio group items, following the WAI-ARIA guidelines |
| `blur`     | Function used to blur any focused radio group item                          |

```js
const api = connect(state, send)

api.value
// 'apple' | 'orange' | 'grape'

api.setValue("pears")
api.value
// pears
```

## Usage within forms

To use radio group within forms, use the exposed `inputProps` from the `connect`
function and ensure you pass `name` value to the machine's context. It will
render a hidden input and ensure the value changes get propagated to the form
correctly.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  radio.machine({
    name: "fruits",
  }),
)
```

## Styling guide

Earlier, we mentioned that each radio part has a `data-part` attribute added to
them to select and style them in the DOM.

### Focused State

When the radio input is focused, the `data-focus` attribute is added to the
root, control and label parts.

```css
[data-part="item"][data-focus] {
  /* styles for item focus state */
}

[data-part="item-control"][data-focus] {
  /* styles for item control focus state */
}

[data-part="item-label"][data-focus] {
  /* styles for item label focus state */
}
```

### Disabled State

When the radio is disabled, the `data-disabled` attribute is added to the root,
control and label parts.

```css
[data-part="item"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for item disabled state */
}

[data-part="item-control"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for item control disabled state */
}

[data-part="item-label"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for item label disabled state */
}
```

### Invalid State

When the radio is invalid, the `data-invalid` attribute is added to the root,
control and label parts.

```css
[data-part="item"][data-invalid] {
  /* styles for item invalid state */
}

[data-part="item-control"][data-invalid] {
  /* styles for item control invalid state */
}

[data-part="item-label"][data-invalid] {
  /* styles for item label invalid state */
}
```
